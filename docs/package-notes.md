# package-notes.md

Below are notes that were originally inline comments in `package.json`, but were removed
to satisfy npm’s strict JSON parsing rules. This file documents the reasoning and usage
of certain fields within `package.json`.

---

## Overview of Fields

### 1. `"main": "src/main/main.js"`
- This tells Electron (or Node) to treat `src/main/main.js` as the main entry script 
  when running the app.  
- When we do `electron .`, it looks for `"main"` in `package.json` and loads this file.

### 2. `"scripts": { "start": "electron ." }`
- By running `npm start`, npm calls `electron .`, which starts Electron from the project root.  
- Because `"main"` is set to `"src/main/main.js"`, `electron .` knows to open that file 
  as the main process.

### 3. `"devDependencies": { "electron": "^35.0.3" }`
- This pins Electron to version `^35.0.3`.  
- `"devDependencies"` means it’s only required in development for building/running the app.

### 4. Large Dependencies List
- We have packages like `cacheable-request`, `got`, etc.  
- If not all are used in your actual code, they can be removed to reduce size. However, 
  as of now, they’re included, possibly for future expansions or experiments.

### 5. Additional Scripts You Could Add
- For example, you might add `"build"` or `"package"` scripts if you use a bundler:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "electron .",
    "build": "electron-builder",
    "package": "electron-packager . RetailPOS --platform=win32 --arch=x64"
  }
